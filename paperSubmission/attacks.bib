  abstract  = {A Turing Award-winning computer scientist and statistician shows how understanding causality has revolutionized science and will revolutionize artificial intelligence"Correlation is not causation." This mantra, chanted by scientists for more than a century, has led to a virtual prohibition on causal talk. Today, that taboo is dead. The causal revolution, instigated by Judea Pearl and his colleagues, has cut through a century of confusion and established causality--the study of cause and effect--on a firm scientific basis. His work explains how we can know easy things, like whether it was rain or a sprinkler that made a sidewalk wet; and how to answer hard questions, like whether a drug cured an illness. Pearl's work enables us to know not just whether one thing causes another: it lets us explore the world that is and the worlds that could have been. It shows us the essence of human thought and key to artificial intelligence. Anyone who wants to understand either needs The Book of Why.},

% This might be a great one: "We find that in both cases, the time gap between subsequent posts is the most significant indicator of diminishing interest of users, besides other indicative factors like answering speed, reputation of those who answer their questions, and number of answers received by the user." - those kinds of studies are the ones in which we can neatly contribute with our narrative and add another predictor of diminished interest/decreased engagement // also, speaking in terms of user churn is something our potential customers will very well understand :))

  abstract = {Understanding how people use technology remains important, particularly when measuring the impact this might have on individuals and society. However, despite a growing body of resources that can quantify smartphone use, research within psychology and social science overwhelmingly relies on self-reported assessments. These have yet to convincingly demonstrate an ability to predict objective behavior. Here, and for the first time, we compare a variety of smartphone use and ‘addiction’ scales with objective behaviors derived from Apple's Screen Time application. While correlations between psychometric scales and objective behavior are generally poor, single estimates and measures that attempt to frame technology use as habitual rather than ‘addictive’ correlate more favorably with subsequent behavior. We conclude that existing self-report instruments are unlikely to be sensitive enough to accurately predict basic technology use related behaviors. As a result, conclusions regarding the psychological impact of technology are unreliable when relying solely on these measures to quantify typical usage.},

The interventions were based on three psychological mechanisms: induction of a descriptive norm, induction of a prescriptive norm, and empathy induction. Each intervention was generated using a communicating bot. Participants exposed to these interventions were compared with a control group that received no intervention. The bot-generated normative communications (both the ones priming descriptive and the ones priming prescriptive norms), as well as the empathizing intervention, reduced the proportion of verbal aggression posted by Reddit accounts. All three interventions proved effective in reducing verbal violence when compared with the control condition.},

  abstract = {Understanding how people use technology remains important, particularly when measuring the impact this might have on individuals and society. However, despite a growing body of resources that can quantify smartphone use, research within psychology and social science overwhelmingly relies on self-reported assessments. These have yet to convincingly demonstrate an ability to predict objective behavior. Here, and for the first time, we compare a variety of smartphone use and ‘addiction’ scales with objective behaviors derived from Apple's Screen Time application. While correlations between psychometric scales and objective behavior are generally poor, single estimates and measures that attempt to frame technology use as habitual rather than ‘addictive’ correlate more favorably with subsequent behavior. We conclude that existing self-report instruments are unlikely to be sensitive enough to accurately predict basic technology use related behaviors. As a result, conclusions regarding the psychological impact of technology are unreliable when relying solely on these measures to quantify typical usage.},

            National governments now recognize online hate speech as a pernicious social problem. In the wake of political votes and terror attacks, hate incidents online and offline are known to peak in tandem. This article examines whether an association exists between both forms of hate, independent of `trigger' events. Using Computational Criminology that draws on data science methods, we link police crime, census and Twitter data to establish a temporal and spatial association between online hate speech that targets race and religion, and offline racially and religiously aggravated crimes in London over an eight-month period. The findings renew our understanding of hate crime as a process, rather than as a discrete event, for the digital age.},

	abstract = {In a divided world, empathy is not the solution, it is the problem. We think of empathy -- the ability to feel the suffering of others for ourselves -- as the ultimate source of all good behaviour. But while it inspires care and protection in personal relationships, it has the opposite effect in the wider world. As the latest research in psychology and neuroscience shows, we feel empathy most for those we find attractive and who seem similar to us and not at all for those who are different, distant or anonymous. Empathy therefore biases us in favour of individuals we know while numbing us to the plight of thousands. Guiding us expertly through the experiments, case studies and arguments on all sides, Paul Bloom ultimately shows that some of our worst decisions -- in charity, child-raising, criminal justice, climate change and war -- are motivated by this wolf in sheep's clothing. Brilliantly argued, urgent and humane, Against Empathy overturns widely held assumptions to reveal one of the most profound yet overlooked sources of human conflict.},

@book{russo_causality_2008,
	abstract = {The anti-causal prophecies of last century have been disproved. Causality is neither a `relic of a bygone' nor `another fetish of modern science'; it still occupies a large part of the current debate in philosophy and the sciences.  This investigation into causal modelling presents the rationale of causality, i.e. the notion that guides causal reasoning in causal modelling. It is argued that causal models are regimented by a rationale of variation, nor of regularity neither invariance, thus breaking down the dominant Human paradigm. The notion of variation is shown to be embedded in the scheme of reasoning behind various causal models: e.g. Rubin's model, contingency tables, and multilevel analysis. It is also shown to be latent -- yet fundamental -- in many philosophical accounts. Moreover, it has significant consequences for methodological issues: the warranty of the causal interpretation of causal models, the levels of causation, the characterisation of mechanisms, and the interpretation of probability. This book offers a novel philosophical and methodological approach to causal reasoning in causal modelling and provides the reader with the tools to be up to date about various issues causality rises in social science. "Dr. Federica Russo's book is a very valuable addition to a small number of relevant publications on causality and causal modelling in the social sciences viewed from a philosophical approach".

@incollection{crittenden_civic_2018,
	abstract = {In its broadest definition, ``civic education'' means allthe processes that affect people's beliefs, commitments,capabilities, and actions as members or prospective members ofcommunities. Civic education need not be intentional or deliberate;institutions and communities transmit values and norms without meaningto. It may not be beneficial: sometimes people are civically educatedin ways that disempower them or impart harmful values and goals. It iscertainly not limited to schooling and the education of children andyouth. Families, governments, religions, and mass media are just someof the institutions involved in civic education, understood as alifelong process.[1] A rightly famous example is Tocqueville's often quotedobservation that local political engagement is a form of civiceducation: ``Town meetings are to liberty what primary schoolsare to science; they bring it within the people's reach, theyteach men how to use and how to enjoy it.'', Nevertheless, most scholarship that uses the phrase ``civiceducation'' investigates deliberate programs of instructionwithin schools or colleges, in contrast to paideia (seebelow) and other forms of citizen preparation that involve a wholeculture and last a lifetime. There are several good reasons for theemphasis on schools. First, empirical evidence shows that civic habitsand values are relatively easily to influence and change while peopleare still young, so schooling can be effective when other efforts toeducate citizens would fail (Sherrod, Flanagan, and Youniss, 2002).Another reason is that schools in many countries have an explicitmission to educate students for citizenship. As Amy Gutmann pointsout, school-based education is our most deliberate form of humaninstruction (1987, 15). Defining the purposes and methods of civiceducation in schools is a worthy topic of public debate. Nevertheless,it is important not to lose sight of the fact that civic educationtakes place at all stages of life and in many venues other thanschools., Whether defined narrowly or broadly, civic education raises empiricalquestions: What causes people to develop durable habits, values,knowledge, and skills relevant to their membership in communities? Arepeople affected differently if they vary by age, social or culturalbackground, and starting assumptions? For example, does a high schoolcivics course have lasting effects on various kinds of students, andwhat would make it more effective? , From the 1960s until the 1980s, empirical questions concerning civiceducation were relatively neglected, mainly because of a prevailingassumption that intentional programs would not have significantand durable effects, given the more powerful influences of socialclass and ideology (Cook, 1985). Since then, many research studies andprogram evaluations have found substantial effects, and most socialscientists who study the topic now believe that educational practices,such as discussion of controversial issues, hands-on action, andreflection, can influence students (Sherrod, Torney-Purta \&Flanagan, 2010)., The philosophical questions have been less explored, but they areessential. For example:, These questions are rarely treated together as part of comprehensivetheories of civic education; instead, they arise in passing in worksabout politics or education. Some of these questions have never beenmuch explored by professional philosophers, but they arise frequentlyin public debates about citizenship.},

	abstract = {The concept of empathy is used to refer to a wide range ofpsychological capacities that are thought of as being central forconstituting humans as social creatures allowing us to know what otherpeople are thinking and feeling, to emotionally engage with them, toshare their thoughts and feelings, and to care for theirwell--being. Ever since the eighteenth century, due particularlyto the influence of the writings of David Hume and Adam Smith, thosecapacities have been at the center of scholarly investigations intothe underlying psychological basis of our social and moral nature.Yet, the concept of empathy is of relatively recent intellectualheritage. Moreover, since researchers in different disciplines havefocused their investigations on very specific aspects of the broadrange of empathy-related phenomena, one should probably not besurprised by a certain amount of conceptual confusion and amultiplicity of definitions associated with the empathy concept in anumber of different scientific and non-scientific discourses. Thepurpose of this entry is to clarify the empathy concept by surveyingits history in various philosophical and psychological discussions andby indicating why empathy was and should be regarded to be of suchcentral importance in understanding human agency in ordinary contexts,in the human sciences, and for the constitution of ourselves as socialand moral agents. More specifically, after a short historicalintroduction articulating the philosophical context within which theempathy concept was coined, the second and third sections will discussthe epistemic dimensions associated with our empathic capacities. Theywill address the contention that empathy is the primary epistemicmeans for knowing other minds and that it should be viewed as theunique method distinguishing the human from the natural sciences.Sections 4 and 5 will then focus on claims that view empathy as thefundamental social glue and that understand empathy as the mainpsychological mechanism enabling us to establish and maintain socialrelations and taking an evaluative stance towards each other.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The replication crisis has prompted many to call for statistical reform within the psychological sciences. Here we examine issues within Frequentist statistics that may have led to the replication crisis, and we examine the alternative---Bayesian statistics---that many have suggested as a replacement. The Frequentist approach and the Bayesian approach offer radically different perspectives on evidence and inference with the Frequentist approach prioritising error control and the Bayesian approach offering a formal method for quantifying the relative strength of evidence for hypotheses. We suggest that rather than mere statistical reform, what is needed is a better understanding of the different modes of statistical inference and a better understanding of how statistical inference relates to scientific inference.},

@book{mcelreath_statistical_2020,
	abstract = {Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan builds your knowledge of and confidence in making inferences from data. Reflecting the need for scripting in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling work.  The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding.  The second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal inference, integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also contains new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with an entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses.  Features   Integrates working code into the main text   Illustrates concepts through worked data analysis examples   Emphasizes understanding assumptions and how assumptions are reflected in code   Offers more detailed explanations of the mathematics in optional sections   Presents examples of using the dagitty R package to analyze causal graphs   Provides the rethinking R package on the author's website and on GitHub},

Why do ideas such as 'fairness' and 'freedom' mean such different things to different people? Why is it so hard to see things from another viewpoint? Why do we come to blows over politics and religion?Jonathan Haidt reveals that we often find it hard to get along because our minds are hardwired to be moralistic, judgemental and self-righteous. He explores how morality evolved to enable us to form communities, and how moral values are not just about justice and equality - for some people authority, sanctity or loyalty matter more. Morality binds and blinds, but, using his own research, Haidt proves it is possible to liberate ourselves from the disputes that divide good people.},

We first uncover unexpected correlations between surface markers of African American English (AAE) and ratings of toxicity in several widely-used hate speech datasets. Then, we show that models trained on these corpora acquire and propagate these biases, such that AAE tweets and tweets by self-identified African Americans are up to two times more likely to be labelled as offensive compared to others. Finally, we propose *dialect* and *race priming* as ways to reduce the racial bias in annotation, showing that when annotators are made explicitly aware of an AAE tweet's dialect they are significantly less likely to label the tweet as offensive.},
