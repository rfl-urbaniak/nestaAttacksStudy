Some folders need to be downloaded separately, as they are too large to live on GitHub.

- the [data folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10qhdM6Pir_o94j_DUUIUFN7mXe079y1i?usp=drive_link) After downloading, make sure that the content of the downloaded folder is identical to the content of `data/`.

- the [models folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10qhdM6Pir_o94j_DUUIUFN7mXe079y1i?usp=drive_link). After downloading, make sure that the content of the downloaded folder is identical to the content of `models/`.
